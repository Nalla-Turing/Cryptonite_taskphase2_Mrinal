# Web EXploitation
<br><br>

## Challenge-1 SOAP
`flag` `picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_4dbeb2ed}`

## Challenge-2 Forbidden Paths
`flag` `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}`
<br>

### Steps to get the flag
1:- starting the instance and goign to webiste we reach a from type of webpage where we can type the txt file as in input and submit

2:- I check if we are in the directory where files are avaialbel or not by using `./oliver.txt`

3:- We are in the right directory. So to get to the currect level we do `../../../../flag.txt` because of the hint that files  exist in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` which is our current directory

4:- our step gives us the correct flag

### Mistakes i made
I tried to go to `/usr/share/nginx/html/` not realising that this is where we already are and my mehtod didn't work, I don't know why?

### Things I learned
just like our pwn challenges in pwncollege we have similar concepts of relative and absolute path when it comes webpages
methods like `../../../` helps goes back in the level to reach the root directory
